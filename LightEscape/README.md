Music 256a/Cs 476a Homework 2 This is a fun synthesizer with 3 oscillators (Sine, Saw, Square) from STK which are all preset with certain ADSR. The unit frequency and the gain can be controlled by users using sliders. In the grid square, the FM effect will be added to the current oscillator. X axis controls the modulator frequency, Y axis controls the index. Have fun!~
Use the Synthesis ToolKit (STK: <https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/stk/>) with JUCE. The project demo is also presented on vimeo.(<https://vimeo.com/187073686>)
