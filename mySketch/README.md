# Cloud Dancer
  
Music 256a/Cs 476a Homework 4 Cloud Dancer can dance with input music(spectrum -> dust motion). The color is controled by the mouse's motion. When the mouse is pressed, there is a preset synth that will play a short period of sound automatically and the speed and pan can be controled by mouse moving up-down and left-right.
