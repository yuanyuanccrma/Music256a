# Advanced Dancer
  
Music 256a/CS 476a Final Project 

This project is based on last homework Dancer with dust motion. The basic idea is to create an immersive environment for a real dancer which could combine real body movements with graphics and sound interactively. Currently, I start with the most basic Kinect Demo provided by Openframeworks.
