# BasicAudio Music 256a HW1 Yuan li

This project demonstrates how to deal with additive synthesis in JUCE. Implement 4 sine wave oscillators where the frequency and the gain are preset as a harmaonic chord which can also be controlled by users using sliders and a checkbox that allows users to enhance the specific oscillator.There is a "Change Tone" slider to change all the oscillators's frequency as well at the same time. Then Also applied a Smooth function to provide a better sound quality.
